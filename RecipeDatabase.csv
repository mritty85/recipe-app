Season salmon with salt and pepper. Heat cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add olive oil, sear salmon skin side down until crispy 2-5 minutes. Orange flesh will turn pale coral up sides, want coral about two-thirds up for medium-rare. Flip, cook until firm 1-2 minutes. Transfer skin side down to plate, keep pan with fat over heat. 2. Add rice to fat, spread in even layer packing down like pancake. Reduce to medium, cook until lightly browned and toasted 5 minutes, should crackle. Flip like pancake using spatula if needed, may not flip in one piece. Cook until toasted on second side 1-2 minutes. Go longer for crispier rice. 3. While rice cooks, stir gochugaru, maple syrup, rice vinegar, 1 tsp salt in small bowl. When rice done, divide among plates. In empty pan, add gochugaru mixture, cook stirring constantly over medium-high until bubbles and reduces significantly 15 seconds to 1 minute, should look sticky. Turn off heat, add cold butter, stir until melted and incorporated. Pour glaze over salmon, serve with cucumbers or pickles.","Find gochugaru at Korean/Asian supermarkets, most grocery stores, online. Freezes beautifully, tastes great dusted over anything. For spicier, increase gochugaru. Day-old rice works best as it's drier and crisps better. Try brown rice for nuttier flavor and fiber. Add sliced scallions or sesame seeds as garnish. Leftover crispy rice great in rice bowls or fried rice."
