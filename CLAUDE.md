# RocketHaus Recipes Mobile App - Project Context

## Project Overview
A mobile-optimized Progressive Web App (PWA) for browsing and searching recipes, built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend and Google Sheets as a backend CMS.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript hosted on GitHub Pages
- **Backend**: Google Apps Script web app providing REST API
- **Database**: Google Sheets (easy content management)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (free static hosting)
- **PWA**: Service worker for offline functionality

## Current Implementation

### Data Structure
The recipe database uses these columns in Google Sheets:
- `Recipe_Name` - Name of the recipe
- `Cuisine` - Type of cuisine (Mediterranean, Italian, American, etc.)
- `Type` - Category (Spice Blend, Stew, Pasta, Soup, etc.)
- `Prep_Time` - Preparation time in minutes
- `Cook_Time` - Cooking time in minutes  
- `Total_Time` - Total time in minutes
- `Servings` - Number of servings
- `Source` - Recipe source (URL, page number, or blank)
- `Tags` - Pipe-separated tags (21DSD|Vegetarian|One Pot|etc.)
- `Ingredients` - Comma-separated ingredients list
- `Instructions` - Numbered step instructions
- `Variations_Tips` - Additional notes and variations
- `Thumbnail` - Image URL for recipe photo (GitHub Pages hosted images)

### Current API Endpoints
Google Apps Script provides these endpoints:
- `GET /` - Returns all recipes as JSON
- `GET /?action=search&q=query` - Search recipes
- `GET /?action=recipe&id=index` - Get specific recipe

### Deployment Status
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mritty85/recipe-app
- **Live App**: https://mritty85.github.io/recipe-app
- **Google Apps Script URL**: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby3dnWwo1wELZqjkT0NvOJzlW5hwB88IdY-MLDIXb5PxDGWBODgGS-kNGy-wScSlkoemQ/exec

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **CSS**: Custom responsive design with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Typography**: Google Fonts (Work Sans, JetBrains Mono)
- **Color Scheme**: Warm earth tones (#BCC4B7, #F4E8D7, #8B6F47)
- **Backend**: Google Apps Script (serverless)
- **Data**: Google Sheets API
- **Build**: None required (static files)
- **Deploy**: Git push triggers GitHub Pages deployment

## Development Notes
- Built mobile-first with touch interactions in mind
- Uses semantic HTML for accessibility
- CSS Grid for responsive recipe card layout
- Service worker caches static assets and images separately for offline use
- Google Apps Script handles CORS automatically
- No build process required - simple deployment pipeline
- Recipe detail uses edge-to-edge full-page view for cooking safety
- Source URLs display as "Recipe Source" links for cleaner presentation
- Only explicit close button can dismiss recipe view (no click-outside)
- Recipe images hosted on GitHub Pages with smart emoji fallbacks
- Context-aware emoji selection based on recipe name (üçù for pasta, üçï for pizza, etc.)
- Graceful degradation for broken or missing image URLs
- Copy ingredients functionality with clipboard integration for easy shopping list creation
- Clean ingredient formatting compatible with Notes app workflow for Apple Reminders conversion
- Optimized recipe card layout: cuisine/type as subheader, 50-50 split for time/servings
- Custom Google Fonts: Work Sans (headers) and JetBrains Mono (body text)
- Warm earth tone color palette replacing blue theme for better visual appeal
- Removed "Source:" label from recipe links for cleaner presentation

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Keeps bundle size minimal, fast loading
2. **Google Sheets**: Non-technical users can easily manage recipes
3. **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with automatic deployments
4. **PWA**: Installable, works offline, feels native on mobile
5. **Single Page App**: Smooth navigation without page reloads
6. **GitHub Images**: Store recipe images in repo for version control and free hosting
7. **Smart Fallbacks**: Emoji placeholders provide visual consistency when images unavailable

## Performance Characteristics
- Initial load: ~50KB total (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Recipe data: Fetched once, cached in memory
- Images: Cached separately by service worker for offline viewing
- Offline: Full functionality available after first load, including cached images
- Mobile-optimized: Touch targets, readable fonts, fast scrolling
- Graceful degradation: App works perfectly with or without images

## Image Management
- **Storage**: Recipe images stored in `/images/` folder in GitHub repository
- **URLs**: Use GitHub Pages URLs: `https://mritty85.github.io/recipe-app/images/filename.jpg`
- **Fallbacks**: Context-aware emoji placeholders (üçù, üçï, üçó, etc.) for missing images
- **Caching**: Service worker caches images for offline availability
- **Format**: Supports any web image format (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.)

This foundation provides excellent scalability for future enhancements while maintaining simplicity and performance.
